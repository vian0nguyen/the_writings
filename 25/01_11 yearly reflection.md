Hey again,

It's been a couple days into the year but I won't be hard on myself for it. Man, this year. So to recap: 

I'm still technically unemployed. I've been job searching for a year now and I'm still at it. I got part time work at an escape room in Arlington which is an hr commute one way. The work is pretty good and I feel appreciate there.

I'm starting a new project with Filament Games, as their contractor. I know Dan feels bad for laying me off (as he should) so I appreciate the work.

There's a tiny spark of some work with Smruti's company. The son of the CEO is working on a pretty early stages pitch for a more technological escape room type experience. Something more immersive but not VR or AR.
If that becomes real work for real money, who knows.

And, to placate my mom's desire for me to go back to school I agreed in Fall 2025 I'd apply for community college if I still don't have work by then. Which has made me explore the possibility of considering a User Experience, Tech+Media graduate program. Which I won't be ready to apply for until 2026. It's in the back of my mind but something about going back to school really erks me.

So, yeah, within the past couple weeks things have been spinning up. On paper, my whole 2024 can be seen as pretty quiet. My mom describes it as stuck. No job offers, just applications with no responses. (MOS did give me a verbal offer then ghosted me so..)

But if I look at the past year aith a different frameling ofnsuccess, one not boundnby On Paper successes or number of offers or whatever. I'd say 2024 was very hard but I grew a ton out of it. Being laid off this long has really made me count my lucky stars. And made/forced me to be patient with myself. It's such a long time to be grinding for work that I just couldn't keep it uo. I opted for more sustainable practices of applying, sending applications every week and not everyday. 

Financially, on paper I'm okay but not putting away money for my savings for a year doesn't make me feel awesome. I'd feel more burdensome about the money stuff if I didn't have Ria here to be so understanding and on the same page as me. She's oftwn the one deterring my spending on little things. 

Weirdly though, in a parallel universe where my parents money is plentiful: we bought s house! in Virginia! Minh and Jaz live there for now and are paying off the mortgage. It's super adorable and exciting to have property in my name.

Some strides have hapoened with Family too. I'm self reflecting and accepting my mom cannot provide me with emoti
