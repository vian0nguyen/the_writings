the elephant felt plain and met the peacock and felt more plain
"where are my colors? why cant i be colorful?"

the elephant met the frog and wondered 
"why cant i be ombre?"

the elephant met the zebra and wondered
"where are my stripes? why cant i be black and white?"

the elephant met the calico cat and wondered
"what are these spots? i want to have colors too."

the elephant met all the animals and wondered, "why was i made like this? to be so plain?"

then an animal that wears a little outfit or dyes its self ran by.
"you may be plain but nature provides. see these berries? they stain red. see these leaves? they are designed to look like hearts. why can't you borrow natures beauty? find your beauty in the world we are provided."

the animals are stuffed animals that can talk

they all start plain and the elephant is sad and then gets the most elanorate clothes "sorry it took so long i wanted to get the details right"
