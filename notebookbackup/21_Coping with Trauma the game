narratively easier levels are emotionally difficult
|
|
| pick up new skills for coping, become stronger at facing your fears
|
| defeat your fears and what makes you scared
|
|
|
|
| find the absence of fear, the acute amnesia associated with sever trauma
how do you cope with this? how do you fight absence?
|
| discover the fears you defeated are just captured. in a box.
they are not gone. they are only compartmentalized and can still hurt you
they are still in need of _something_
|
stop fighting. hold your fears in your hands and bless them. 
Thank them for keeping you safe even if you did not need them.
explore the fears that _are_ useful and ask them how you can love them
|
|
| this new way of coping is ultimately more difficult
but it's not a bandaid solution anymore.
you accept yourself and all that you are
