## What can you make with an artist and game designer in Unity in 2 months (ie 24 hrs?)
open questions: what are ben's specific learning objectives/goals
### art avenues and spaces of learning in unity:
* basic 2D animation events - hooking them up to scripted game events
* basic 3D pipeline - get 3D models into the game
* basic unity code, getting familiar with the hierarchy, UI/UX? click and drag stuff
* basic unity code, 2d platformer - get from point a to point b

### ideas
* a tribute to eric carle - unmoving plaid style - unity mask images?
* exploring a space in birds eye view
* racing game roadtrip but relaxing - games of ispy, radio, conversations -> made in twine?
* cooking mini game, improve and replacements, meditations on eating as sustaining the body
