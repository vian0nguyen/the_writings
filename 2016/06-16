“Breakfast for dinner?”
They snickered and laughed.
“That’s so weird!”
They wailed in your face

Puzzled, but you stay quiet.
You’ve never known
Any other way of this,
“Breakfast”

With Mom off to work before you awoke
With Dad off...somewhere.
Mom had to make double, triple servings of dinner
To feed you and Minh in the morning and night.

You only saw her sometimes,
Rushing from her room to the garage door,
Rushing from her past to 
Your family’s brighter tomorrow.

On the occasions she was there,
Bright and early in the morning
She smiled in the light of her
Beautiful, colorful dishes

Cơm chiên
Bánh canh
Mì Op La
Phở tái

They all reflected
The beauty of your culture
The brilliance of what makes us
Who we are.
