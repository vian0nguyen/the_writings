And as the bull grows heavy
hooves dig into the ground.
Follow the slow sink into the deep earth
it calls you, it asks for rest.

All the momentum esccapes you.
Inertia, once a novel idea,
a beautiful fantasy.

Above you the sun moves past.
then the stars ase you disappear into soil.
Perhaps it wasn't meant to be.
Maybe you were destined for the grave.
