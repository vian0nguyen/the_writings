I used to think there was a "right" way to pray. I still want to ask people what they think about when they pray. When you light that joss stick and clasp the sticks between your hands. What is going through your mind? All i think about is flooding my head with infinite love and hope that those that I love that are gone now know I love them. It's my moment to give them space in my thoughts. Most of which are just infinite love and wanting them to be okay. I think they are.
I have no ego about my prayers. Maybe it reaches them maybe it doesnt. But I pray anyway because maybe if they can hear it. They'll know I love them and miss them.
I don't wish for anything. I don't want anything from them. Not anything they can give me.
All I want is to send them my love.
