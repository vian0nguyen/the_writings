lying within the spaces of a translation  was the truth.
hidden in plain sight, a gift I was born seeing

she held my words on her tongue split them open dissected it
reassembled each sound  tucked back in, neatly, exactly as it was.

and therein lies the truth.
she translated a mirror image of my expression
something clinical and exacting.
her words selected for accuracy not emotion.

i filled the page with adoration and heartache
she translated a simple copy, word for word.

a year later i realize too perfectly this metaphor writes itself
between the lines i saw warm times we shared
between the lines she only saw spaces.

am i destined for a love that smiles politely back at me?
loves that nod in my direction and content that i am there?

i havent heard from her in a while and to be honest I'd have nothing to say
new love frightens me     because the joy could be fleeting   the impact of the fall could hurt worse

each step i take is focused
i must not get lost in a horizon i may never reach
i must answer only one question: will my feet continue to carry me?
