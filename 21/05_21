and so we listen
the sounds of the waves of language pouring over me
i don't write so much
but i listen to the way we piece together language
poetry is around us all the time.

it's not a hidden knowledge
no secret spell
never needed a tome to translate
i listen to the pieces and our way we puzzle through life
the poetry in my life and in the way people love me

i don't need to write it all down
i hold these strings close to the chest
i tell them thank you and add them into my breath
for now the languages comes and goes
the knots furl but never tangle
i don't need to pull it all apart and understand it
i trust the language will guide me
