# Thoughts
What if the modality for the work I have been making is not one optimized for my own personal enjoyment? is it possible to make a multiplicity of anything w/o pidgeoning myself into a brand or aesthetic? can I root myself in purpose rather than capitalistic pursuits like brand identity?

## Why play games that are not fun?
I believe our definition of "fun" can be bigger and more complicated than we allow it to be. Games that are challenging and difficult to experience are fun in that perserverance through difficult times can be satisfying. We can have fun playing a game that confrunts us with our discomfort with loss or other uncomfortable topics in so far as the "fun" or entertainment we experience helps us become stronger or allws us to play through scenarios. Horror movies are a kind of fun too. People watch and experience discomfort as a way to check in with their own mortality. Perhaps this is the appeal of difficult games.

## it's nice to have throughts that belong completely to me
perhaps people don't worry about me and my future cause they can tell how much I worry about those tings for myself.

## translation
I get really sad when i think about translations. Like an admission she sees how I feel and she does not understand it. Her translations, I cannot read but those around us can. They look and decry them, unfeeling, without care. And what does that mean for us? I can't verify it but I do call upon those moments. How easy it is to blanket our together with knowledge that we meant nothing...or at least something else. In my heart, it feels like I'll always be holding you but I will not say because you never told me that I was in your plan. I will not assume I get a spot in your life as you should not assume I'll be here for you forever.
