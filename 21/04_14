i used to be filled with jealousy when i heard accents.
The twisting of their constanants from what I was taught felt like
A clear assertion of self, a steadiness I cannot claim for myself.

Assimilation was a spotlight and I was standing in it's sights.
Every part of me that stuck out I had to fix, make myself small or not at all.
My shadow needed to slot in to everyone elses.
I did not want to be noted.

But accents only exist in the perception of others.
My thoughts cannot be policed by others if they do not exist outside myself.
It's in my thoughts I dream vividly.
I tell myself "yes" when my thoughts seem much to wacky to say outloud.

I don't have an accent.
I do have the way I am percieved.

I am the house at the corner of neighborhood the one plain on the outside
As if someone cared more about the inside, paying special attention to every detail and forgetting about the rest.
My outsides are more like glass walls, two way mirrors?
A one to one reflection of my insides. 
I have nothing to hide.
Why build myself twice and perform one over the other when I could build up a masterpiece once and exist in that?

I am me and my thoughts are not but I am me.
