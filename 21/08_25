Drown me in my own mundanity
I wish never to be seen or captured by the spotlight.
Let me exist in secluded peace.
I will never transgress.
Comfortably I'll sit in and around the average faultline.

Nothing of note, nothing to note, nothing wrong.

Maybe that's why we seek out love.
Love to pull us from the depths of our normal.
A love to hold us by the shoulders and stare at us right in our uniqueness.

Whats the point of fame if the people who love me, have loved me, will love me touch every part of my heart so completely?
What necessity does posterity afford me if in the time I've lived and loved being alive was filled to the brim with love?
Why must people remember me after I'm gone?

If not for the brightness of my smile, the joy in my laugh, what memories of me are worth preserving?
All that follow /me/ are my mistakes, my discomfort, the hurt I've caused.
Leave them all behind and hold /me/ the memory of me standing right ahead.
In the flesh, I might always disappoint you, always say the wrong things, be the wrong thing,
But, in memory I can be shaped to be perfect.
THROW ME AWAY.

I've never known perfect.
And in your memory, I hope my mistakes haunt you.
I hope all my imperfections shine through like broken glass.

What makes my average special is the way I've broken down.
Unlike anyone else, truly a snowflake.
