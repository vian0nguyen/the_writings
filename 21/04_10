in the beautiful scrawlings you left me with they mark all over my skin. what remains of the times we shared.
my skin stained by the memories we made.
hidden in our garden of eden ill find the etching i left for you to find. 
“i love you”
never acknowledged, never returned. you smiled upon me innocently like i’d asked you to pass the blanket on the couch we shared late nights on.
in the darkest of night when i’d find you waiting for me to come home. my heart held you in place like stone.
i kept you safe. i kept you stationary. i preserved the parts of you i needed like a photo recording the happiest version of our past for me to cherish forever.
but now finally i let myself let go of you.
of your smile, of your smell, of the feeling of your hand gently patting my head, of the softness of your voice lying to me and telling me it would be fine.
I know now I will be fine. 
Untethered from a love that never was.
The belief that our union would get me through like a buoy weathering a storm.

You are not my ground and I will stop asking you to be.
It’s in me that I’ve found my whole and it’s in you to find that my new etching is in past tense now. 
“I loved you.”
Now instead of trying to wash away the sweet aftertaste you left me with I am marked and I embrace it.
Like watercolors I’ve been mixing my own memories and my own joy I’ve found in myself.
Discovering new colors in the beauty of being present with myself.
The love we had surely was special but it does not mean I cannot find it once again in myself.
