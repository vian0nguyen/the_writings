I need help to tell my stories
alone, my stories will hurt me.
they tell me tales of pain and really don't shy away from the darkness.
I seek the brightness of co-conspirators.
My contemporaries have light to shine on my chaos, on pure tragedy.

I don't want to be hurt by my stories. I want to share them,
Bring them to the surface where their pain is duller.

----

Sometimes I feel eyes tear me apart.
They pull apart my clothes, my skin, dissect me on a table of longing. 
I imagine what words could be exchanged to get bodies pressed together like that? Oh, so much I love the attention.
I too want to be pried open like an orange with nothing but juices sweet to the taste.
Wanted and devoured like water in the desert. Oh, how this longing could eat me alive.
Sensations new, unnamed until him.
I do not want his body but I thank him for showing me how to spell this sensation on my tongue.
Being wanted, desired, dissected, torn apart.
