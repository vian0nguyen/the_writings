he wasn’t buried here. Not in this cemetery.
But the tombstones noting the bodies that lay below makes me think about where else bodies go. 
Thinking of all the bodies beneath us as we stand above ground constantly growing and changing… they grow and change too.
His body lays somewhere in Wisconsin blanketed by the dirt of a cemetery I’ve never been. 
His body wears 7 years of decay the way I imagine he wears the clothes they buried him in
While I’ve grown so has he. While i grew up he became worm food or a rabbit or a tree.
Romantically, his death has to produce a kind of output, the kind that makes all the pain worthwhile, worth living through.
Tragically, it doesn’t matter. Who I knew him as is gone now and I will never receive a text message from him again.
Realistically, it does matter. I don’t think of him everyday anymore but he does live inside my memories and the stories I tell of him and the people that know him for who he was to me.

I am who I am because of him. 
Til the very end and even beyond.
We call it a ripple.
One life lost reverberating the unseen network of people who all feel the pain. Collectively absorb the shock.
We live on and we meet new people and sometimes they die. The reverberations continue.
And yet, we continue to choose to love again.
I continue to love again.
I am changed by the people who haven’t died. I am changed by the people I adore. I am changed by the people I am ungrateful for. I am shaped by the people I’ve forgotten. I am changed by the people who don’t know me.
And so we continue to reverberate.
