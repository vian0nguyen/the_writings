The sun comes into the windows
The glitter hits my skin, not poison, not pain.
The birds twitter lightly on the breeze beckoning an arrival from the day.

In the softness of morning I seat myself
In my own heart and within my own place
I belong in the places I make for me
I belong to the world around me.
I am whole for myself and the light I bring.
The sun reaches out a hand for me,
Knowing I'll take it when I'm ready.
