and so the flood proceeds me.
i stand and face it, washed away
let the tears guide me, show me the scars once burning, a fire that raged
Now, the bleeding is done, and the wounds are crystaline.

everything ends and so too does the pain.
i stand sullen at the shore, watching the tide rip at me
the waves always reach me but i know this time i won't drown.
i know the waves want to heal me, shake me apart until the scar tissue releases me

i am raw and i feel everything
i still choose love that might release pain
it will be okay. it always will be.
