One
The moon, big and heavy in the evening sky
Just before the sun hides for the day.
The big white ball floats adoringly.

Two
A warm breath into the night air
The small billowing cloud of smoke
A hopeful sigh of relief.

Three
Chorus of voices in a Savers parking lot
Laughing, joking, shouting,
Singing the first part of Christmas Shoes.

Four
Another camera angle into a diner.
Diners look the same.
Milkshakes melted, conversation lively.
