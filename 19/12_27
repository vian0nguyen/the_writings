take as much as you want from me.
until i tell you to stop.
do not apologize for needing my support.
i want to stand strong for you.

some people save my life everyday
without even knowing it.
what’s another lost boy in a sea of screaming?
it’s an interconnected web of cherishing, love, and care.

when we fall, our strings pull taut, they snap
the ones we leave behind are left with broken memories.
these strings have saved me everytime.
when i remember my mom, my friends, my loves, my lost.

mom, she gave me this life.
she gifted me my future.
her strength and her sacrifice,
her hardship all for the love of her children.
so, rely on me.

friends, too many to name.
they've given me too much to list.
taught me to accept love.
taught me to explore perspective.
so, rely on me.

loves, too many to name:
every change of the season,
the color of the sky full of soft clouds,
a nice patch of sun on the grass i lay on,
the moment of waking up,
the small new bud on a plant.

lost, di hai, my late aunt,
skylar, my friend and love who ended his life,
my late uncles, i’ve never met,
my ancestors, i don’t know,
so rely on me.

tell me,
whatever you wish.

thank you.
