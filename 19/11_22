I want to recede
Like waves into the endless sea
Like a turtle into its shell
Like a star, I want to collapse into myself.

But waves come back, their tides ever stronger
And turtles need the sunshine to remember that it's there
And stars, they burst and expand into even brighter nebulas

I can too.
