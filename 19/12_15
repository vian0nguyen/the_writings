Death is natural
Forgetting is inevitable

I am in love with no one
But everyday i am alive
I am in love.
This life is a blessing
Everyday is a gift
I am surrounded by
every memory of
    a kiss on the forehead
    an enveloping hug
    a squeal of reunion
    a pat on the head
    a soft heartbeat between palms
    a laughter that bubbles from the gut

every moment brings me to tears
not for the sadness of a time passed
but for the joy of witnessing 
such a beautiful gift

I cannot say enough thank yous
Iâ€™ll never find the right words of gratitude
But everyday I wake up is another day
			 another gift
