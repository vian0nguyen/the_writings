One
Reflections and refractions of light
Bouncing off water
The perfect color palate.
The gold yellow against a dark night blue sky
Itâ€™s the non-stop drip of the rain onto our earth.

Two
Through the thin surface
Yellow beam casts through yellow barrier
Shapes dancing from a connected line
The night air shakes the leaves

Three
The illusion of nearness and farness
Blurred and warped.
All light reflecting off the pavement
Lights stretch tall like stalks in the ground
They reach for me.

Four
Beat shakes through floor
Reverberates through my feet and into my muscles
I allow my body to move and slide through imaginary lines
I feel the weight of my body shift and shift and shift
Every peak in the sound finds its way out of my limbs.
