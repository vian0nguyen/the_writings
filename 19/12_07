You don’t notice the bloom tucked beneath the yellowing old leaf.
Everything looks like death this time of year.
As we descend into the inhabitable cold the plants lose their leaves and we see the sky.
But we don’t notice the seeds that have started to germinate deep in the wet soil.
We don’t notice the life that sleeps just beyond our sight, hibernating, resting.

All my plants look like they’re dying.
But just beyond the drooping browning leaves, 
You’ll find their bloom.
