And as the bull grows heavy
hooves dig into the ground.
Follow the slow sink into the deep earth
it calls you, it asks for rest.

All the momentum escapes you.
Inertia, once a novel idea,
a beautiful fantasy.

Above you the sun moves past.
then the stars ase you disappear into soil.
Perhaps it wasn't meant to be.
Maybe you were destined for the grave.

Above you the other animals smile down.
Gently, they blanket you in cool dirt.
"Please rest" they say "you've worked hard for this."
Until long you don't remember the sun that races by.

Have you ever been like that?
Could you ever move that fast?
Surely it wasn't possible for you.
