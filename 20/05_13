I didn’t know I’d make it.
These two feet carried me here
into the sunlight thats constantly setting.
These shadows dance, they sway and cheer me on.

In this sunstream, my skin is warmed.
I crave the light sinking into my body.
I’ll keep one foot in front of the other
I can’t wait to find where the light starts.

For my adventure here and now,
I gaze slightly beyond the horizon line.
I want to bask in the journey and take in every sight.
With all it’s wonder, it’s pain and it’s glory:
I want it all.
