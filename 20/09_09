i beg you
break my heart 
with your laugh

if you dare call my name
id come back to you

it was you that mended me
reminded me of a normal love
and its you who neglected me
no energy to be around me

would you notice if i wasnt there? by your side? would you even call for me?
i know the answer
i've known it all along
but i still hold my heart out for you
waiting in the silence
to feel the tempo through your hand

happy birthday **
