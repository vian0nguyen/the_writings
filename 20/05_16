If you lie to yourself, how would you know?
Have I ever told myself the truth?
These silences are deafening.
Every untruth I tell myself is a tug at my insides.
Digesting a knife, the untruth slides through my within.
What will it find?
Maybe it will guide me to my truth.
This body conceals layers of scars behind the beating, the contracting, the tension.

Maybe once I am taken apart I will be at home with myself.
Once I ransack these organs, this tissue, these fluids,
I’ll find where I originate, I’ll find where I belong.

Maybe peeling back the layers, I’ll feel at home in my own skin.
Finally, I’ll be warmed by my epidermis, feeling safe and soft.
I’ll build a nest to protect me within the confines of these long, endless intestines.
Unwrap my brain, unfurl, and unfold it. I’ll lay my head down gently
Waiting for the weight of my skull to sink into the softness.
Maybe then I will be reunited. reborn. 

I will find the body in which I belong. Someday.
