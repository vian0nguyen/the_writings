My sadness used to smell bitter.
Like the taste of a lemon held between teeth.
My eyes stung sour as my mouth puckered.

Lately, my sadness wafts through the air
bringing ash to my nose.
It’s the smell of a wish floating up into the sky
A promise drifting toward the ones I’ve lost.
A message from the earth-bound to the sky sailors.

Cast off into the unknown.
To you I urge,
I love you. I wish you were here.
I hope you are here.

I am not sad for you.
I only miss your presence in my life.
I only wish I could share more of my tomorrows.

My heart is heavy.
But I am not sad.
I am heavy carrying your memory inside my bones, my heart, and my love.
