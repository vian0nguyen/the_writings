between every message ive pressed enter
theres a thousand words in between.
some words i’ve written on paper,
some i’ve thought in my quietest moments,
some i’ve said to other people.

sometimes all i think about is you.
everything reminds me of you.
everything makes me miss you.

im afraid.
i’m the most fearful of driving you away.
im scared you’ll see my fleshy insides,
the disgusting mess behind this smile.
every time you’ve seen me cry,
it’s another moment i feel like a sailboat.
on the turbulent waters,
washed away salty tears.
i sail further from you, more torn away.
the more i tell you, the more we connect,
the more painful for when you tear me apart.

but, will you tear me apart?
it’s so hard to know.
the other times in my life i could never see it coming
and with you…
i never want to see it coming.

maybe ill drive you away with my voice.
maybe ill drive you away with my silence.
im overflowing with the words im too afraid to say.

like a magnet you pull my vulnerabilities from my mouth
but im so scared our similar polarities will drive us apart.
what a horrible contradiction.
what a stupid conundrum .

do you feel the same?
do you think of me?
do you know how much i love you?
do i know how much you love me?

in every message i wont say,
i hope you find what you need in me.
i hope you stay in my life for a long time.
but like all connection, it comes and goes
and we too will come together and grow apart.
i can only hope that day doesn’t come for a long time.
