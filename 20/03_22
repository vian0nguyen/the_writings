In the glow of the morning sun,
Petals tuck themselves into the cracks of the sidewalk.
The roads are empty aside from me.

This doesn’t feel like apocalypse.
This feels like public loneliness.

If the sun shines upon no one is it truly warm?
If trees bloom blossoms for no one to appreciate, is it even beautiful?
If no one can observe the beauty of spring does it even truly matter?

I wonder if through windows we all long for:
the warmth of the sun,
a hand beating against ours,
the soft, comforting embrace,
a jaunt laugh heard from two inches away.

Through the window it’s hard to see the moon sometimes.
The stars twinkle for themselves now.

In this empty city, I feel at ease.
No more worrying about my appearance to others,
No more pasted smiles to strangers and passersby,
No more second guessed small talking.
Finally my heart stops racing and it’s just me and my mind.
