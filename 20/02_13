the scent of your detergent echoes on my clothes
your breath on a whisper meant only for me.
hands intertwined, beating hearts pressed between palms.
cold hands & feet tucked between body & blanket
but warmth radiates from our conversations,
    from your laugh.

when I’m not with you I think of our pocket of this universe we made together.
more than loving you, you are my soul’s other half
    two parts made whole
In you, I’ve found something familiar, home.

No matter how dark the days,
No matter how cold the nights,
I’ll always find my way home to you.

I’m desperate for every minute I get with you.
Together we are inevitable.
