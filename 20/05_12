Never allow me to grow toward anyone.
I will never enwrap my limbs with another so deeply I lose myself.
I know my end and I know my beginning.
I will not ask for your permission to thrive.

While, I may need the water and I may need the sun
I am no vine.
I am not moss.
I do not need your body and I do not need your love.

I will thrive beyond the horizon line
I’ll push beyond the quaint soil you set for me
And I’ll rupture the earth beneath me.
I will not grow within your borders because I do not need your love to thrive.

You could not break me. Not with your words,
Or your silence. 
For I am a tree, strong, beyond the canopy you planned for me.
I am my own.

I may be struck down by lightning,
my roots grounding me, exposed.
Know I will lie there without you
to become part of the earth once again.
