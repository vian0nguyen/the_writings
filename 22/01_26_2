what happens when you follow you sad feelings? 
the heavy compression in your chest that makes you feel like youre goig to throw up and implode at the same time?
you cry, you cry and release the heavy a little bit. the weight doesnt go away but its lighter, more managable.
its hard sometimes to identify why the emotion exists. theres something nice about feeling it in full. like accepting it without judgement
