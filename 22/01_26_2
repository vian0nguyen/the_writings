what happens when you follow your sad feelings? 
the heavy compression in your chest that makes you feel like youre goig to throw up and implode at the same time?
you cry, you cry and release the heavy a little bit. the weight doesnt go away but its lighter, more managable.
its hard sometimes to identify why the emotion exists. theres something nice about feeling it in full. like accepting it without judgement.
ive cried now so what! im not at a loss for doing so. i havent hurt anyone or wasted my time.
i acknowledged my feelings! and it feels like i validated myself. i didnt need anyone to tell me its okay to cry.
thats nice.

it feels like self care.
when i cry for myself about qhat i feel i acknowledge myself and feel heard by my own self. thats an amazing feeling to grant myself.
im listening to my body. even if it still confuses me but im hearing me and seeing me and taking me in.
im deserving of having my feelings acknowledged even if the feeling isnt great.
things that might not feel great, counter intuitively, but once they are felt make you feel better 
all feelings are transitory, theyll always move through you fleetingly. bask in them while theyre visiting.

i love myself and i love my big feelings.
having feelings at all reminds me im alive and thats wonderful. it feels so good to feel at the ends of my finger tips to the deep center of my chest a geode of pain.
the feelings remind me im alive and that is a gift to experience life and living.
