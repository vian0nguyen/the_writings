in all the work i've done, grinding down my edges.
discovering all the dark spots in me that hide from the light.
i've broken down, built myself up, made myself whole(r) 
-- until i couldnt recognize myself.

tell me how everyone can still see the parts in me? sense them?
the parts in me that shrivels at kindness and care.
how can i _still_ see myself as less than?
Or maybe i don't see myself at all?

maybe being seen by the spotlight of love, awareness, my needs is whats blinding.
what blinds me and brings fear into my heart, all beating violently into my bloodstream.
why am i terrified of being cared for?
why does it make me feel useless?

they all just want to show their care for me. they all want to know what i need.
and it all just scares me.
i shudder at their outstretched arms, the kindness in their eyes and the wounded look when i refuse.
but i must refuse.

if i take in their kindness then what can i be?
how can i stand on the two feet i stand on?
can i ever stand on my own again? if i accept a shoulder to lean on?
all temporary feelings, all temporary care goes away eventually

how can i untense my muscles and accept what im recieving?
is it so wrong to be weary of the kindness? to be afraid i can never reach a normal on my own again?
im afraid to fall because what if i forget what it felt like to stand on the surface, on my own?
im afraid to be enveloped by my mother's care because i know we only has finite time.

i hold my breath, i hold everything in. all my parts i need to keep together.
On my own. because if i can't get through this rocky, difficult, painful life alone
how can i do it at all? how can i survive losing the people i love
and that's truly the base of my fear: im afraid to be loved because im afraid to let go.
