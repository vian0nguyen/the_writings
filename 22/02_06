The moments you miss when you miss someone don't often look like what you expect.
its the quiet in between long pauses. its the body language you catch just out of eye sight.
its the way you catch them looking at you and you look back and take too long to think of something funny so they say what and you say what and then you just laugh.

i forgot about the color of people's eyes. 
Megan's a deep icy blue gets brighter everytime I look at it.
Bobo's a golden ray surrounded by brown
Miriam's a blue ocean, wide and vast.
Kat's a dark black the sparkles in her smile.

When did I stop meeting people's gaze?
What will they see in by brown eyes? 

There's something three dimensional about pauses in real-life.
Silence occupy space and body language fills it.
The subtle motion of an arm, the bend of a knee against chest.
My eyes dart around subtley. 
I bask in this flurry of information and the gentle art of loving and knowing my friends enough to translate these motions and tones into feeling.
I am not worried I said something wrong because my heart is so filled by the care I feel from my friends and the care I feel for them.

The laughter coming from another room makes my skin warm.
They can _see_ me and they enjoy me.

Nothing has healed my heart as much as this visit has.
Everyday around all these people, I am filled with love and joy.
Everythings bigger in Texas and my heart is no exception.
