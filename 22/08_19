Some words I've grown to cast away.
Irrelevant to my lifestyle.

Legacy: when everyday is spent fighting for my will to live, legacy becomes less important. Sometimes I just have to make it through the day.
Posterity: To be remembered is a strange desire. It frels in opposition to the privilege of being forgotten.
In Love: I don't live a life without love, in fact I'm surrounded in all aspects of my life by love. But to action the feeling, to be inside it, it'a a debilitating fear to be held in place like that.
Sacred: nothing is private and nothing is sacred. Death never hid from me in my youth, it simply was. If anything was out of bounds then it'd probably be me.
