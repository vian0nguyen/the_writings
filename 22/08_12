Somehow, I don't see the new leaves off the mint tree.
I focus my eyes on the brown wilted mistakes.
The singed pity pulls my attention like a magnet.
I don't see new leaves off the mint tree.

Somehow, I easily forget the people in my life that love me.
I replay final conversations instead of ones that remind me I belong.
I focus on the ones who don't call me back instead of call the ones that would answer.
I always seek the love I don't have.

Eventually, with the guidance of a friend, she points out the new bright green buds.
Their resiliance in the face of my mismanagement. Evidence that today, my best was good enough.
This mint tree won't be another ghost and neither will I.
