Oh, when's the last time i've cried like this.
the kind of tears that are warm and wash over my cheeks like a cleansing flood.
i am renewed to my state newness.

i used to think i was broken after you died.
i used to think i was pieces that could never be put together again.
but now, today i understand - the gift of feeling the loss of your love. the gift of feeling loved by you.
you in my life, you were a gift.

i can't bring you back to life. i can't take back what you did.
And i wouldn't want to. the pain you felt... i couldn't even imagine.
but you will always be in my heart.
you don't always burn a hole in it
and sometimes i don't notice you in a day.
I used to feel like I was forgetting you. but really, you've just found a comfortable resting place inside me.

I will never forget you because all the cliche's are right.
You are part of me and I could never let you go.
