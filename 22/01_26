I can't wait to fall in love the way i fell in love with massachussettes winters. 

it was so slow i didn't notice it. i was so preoccupied by my fear of seasonal affective disorder and by actually spending so much time laying in bed that once i emerged from my nest begruggingly ready to see the sun and smell the air i didn't even know it was happening.
homeostasis.
i spend so much time trying to find meaning in my own numbness. trying to find beauty in the gray dark sky. the magic was so quiet and subtle it took me finally being silent, stop searching to see it.
it was today. on this day i noticed it. 
i was wearing a coat unfit for the wind chill. walking in my 4 layers of clothes i could feel the cold cut through me like needles. cut through my apathy. it doesn't matter what you're doing in the winter, whether you're standing, walking, laying down trying to rest, you all ways feel the cut of the cold. and so, i did. I felt _something_. 

and that's what i love about winters in the east coast. the unavoidable feeling. maybe its pain, maybe its chill, maybe its that tightness in your chest, the sting inside your nose, the freeze of your bones in your body. but every moment of being alive is feeling something. winter is a beautiful reminder of that. no feeling is passive, it's all in your face. the shivers that take over your body and demand your full attention. it's all i can think of.
and the gratitude of shelter. nothing can be taken for granted. everything comes under new scrutiny.
