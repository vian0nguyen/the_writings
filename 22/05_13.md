sometimes they cross my mind the way i cross the street
at the most inopportune moments, with ease and a twist of recklessness
sometimes in my mind they surface fantasies of intimacy.
Once unattanable, frightening a prospect, now the natural conclusion to the thought of their laugh and the way they look at me.

i dream of their touch, their presence in my closest spaces, a pressure on my body
i don't fear the fall this time. gravity will do what it must. and i trust it to take me where i need to be.
and right now all i seek is their attention, their time.
i crave every new thing i can learn about them big or small. 
I crave their kindness in the face of my uncertainty.
i crave all the ways they can talk about the world.

i truly get lost in thinking of them but that doesn't bring me fear.
there's nothing to be scared of when it all just feels right like gravity.
