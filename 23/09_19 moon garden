love to draw the moon and amphibians
garden creatures, monkey, racoon, marsupials and rodents
capybara story would be nice
would love to draw the sun

I. moon garden
in the garden, alight by moon light
the creatures found their way home
where they belong with who they loved
they found peace each night in the quiet, 
the songs of the local frog choir
in the garden, all were provided shelter

II. in the night light
the snail and hare loved to glide though the crisp night air
it was in the darkness that beauty could be seen.
The rare light caught in reflections, stared back into the depths.
things were less lonely when they were dancing.
The body follows it's rhythm, the heart takes the lead.
The snail and hare find peace in the perpetual motion.
Swaying to the beat of their two hearts and the crickets sing along.
