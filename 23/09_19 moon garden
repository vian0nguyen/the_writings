love to draw the moon and amphibians
garden creatures, monkey, racoon, marsupials and rodents
capybara story would be nice
would love to draw the sun

in the garden, alight by moon light
the creatures found their way home
where they belong with who they loved
they found peace each night in the quiet, 
the songs of the local frog choir
in the garden, all were provided shelter
