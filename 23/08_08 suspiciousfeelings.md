hey ive been thinking a bit and im getting this ick feeling. i dont think i understand fully how i feel, or at least I can't name it.

Theres something about the way we stopped being friends that I ponder. I do this often as a way to learn from mistakes and/or a symptom of anxiety. I'm sure both are true.

Humans make patterns in their heads so, i just wanna see how you feel about this pattern I've begun to construct. I only have so much information and feelings can get wrapped up in irrational tangles.

The timing of when we stopped being friends/when we started to be distant was so specific to me. It's when you started making friends with more people in Salem and more of your coworkers at Tea Party.
It felt like you were finding your belonging and was working hard to grow past a lot of the insecurities you have about yourself and how people see you.
It's always great to see. And I'm always proud of you. But as Neph moved up and your work started to cement in your routine I felt it become harder and harder to reach you. 
In my head change in life is positive. People always change and our circumstances change, I get that. But even whem I moved up to Boston, changed jobs, changed apartments I always thougbt it was important to fit you in my new life because you were part of my life. But as these changes started to cement for you, it just didnt seem like you had an interest in trying to find a place in your changing life. It felt so easy and frictionless for you to just stop trying to be my friend and get wrapped up in the relationships you were building that was closer by. Sometimes I think about it. I know rationally these things aren't One thing Over the other but its nuanced and complicated. But from my perspective thats what was easiest narratice to put together. Maybe they understood a different, fresh slate you, maybe they were smarter and had more interrsting conversations with you and maybe they fit in your life easier. Easier to start fresh than try and fix something broken, especially when it brings you so much emotional pain that it outweighs the fixed thing.

So that's the pattern my brain is starting to build a narrative about. That I was an old toy you outgrew and wasn't new or shiny like your new friends. That might not be true (and i really hope it isnt). I guess that's the question in this giant paragraph. From your perspective, what is you narrative for our distancing? I have my perspective but I think knowing yours will help me move on.

And I'm not trying to convince you to mend our relationship. Its something we both have to want, which isnt the case. Maybe its a question of closure. Thanks for being patient and reading to the end.
