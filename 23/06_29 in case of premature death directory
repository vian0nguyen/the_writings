everyone dressed in florals while soft jazz math rock plays

dress me in a thin cotton suit and lay muslin over me for my final rest.

I wont write a eulogy, i want my.loved ones gathered together to write me one. from everyone from all my facets I want everyone to describe my life and its influence.

ill of course have grief game laid out. if you need eulogy materials thats there.

id like this to happen in a temple. i wish i had roots in any one space because i guess i dont.
