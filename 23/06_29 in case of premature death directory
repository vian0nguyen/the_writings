everyone dressed in florals while soft jazz math rock plays

dress me in a thin cotton suit and lay muslin over me for my final rest.

I wont write a eulogy, i want my loved ones gathered together to write me one. from everyone from all my facets I want everyone to describe my life and its influence.

ill of course have grief game laid out. if you need eulogy materials thats there.

id like this to happen in a temple. i wish i had roots in any one space because i guess i dont.
id like a buddhist monk to provide the service ans like in those plays i see have subtitles projected somewhere on the wall.
Both in english and vietnamese.

I want anyone amd everyone to feel included and welcome to pay their respects.
I want my intentions to be known: i do not want there to be fighting, i dont need anyone to prove anything to me, and i hope any resentments can be released because i am dead.

I cant tell people how to feel but I do hope my funeral brings people a kind of joy. A joy of celebrating my time on this earth and the memories I shared. A joy for sharing space and creating the intersections we did.
People are allowed to be sad and mourn my loss, just know I'd wanna be sent off bouyed by love and care and the gratefulness for the time we did have.

If its possible can some of fluffy be buried with me where ever i lay to rest? I don:t knoe how this passing on works but it might be easier to find each other.
If I have ashes don't keep me locked up in a temple.

Whatever happens with my remains I hope is a joyful journey. could be
