My mouth opens and I'm always struck.
Who is saying that?
The resonance in my bones are new to me. 
I'm new to the quiet rumble of the approaching train that is my introduction

When the sound cuts out as if the service was overpowered and briefly interrupted.
The squeak that builds from a muteness, a pause.

Who is that talking?
Whose voice drags on the ground a bit like frayed jeans

The heights where I naturally hover is no longer home to me
My voice is found lower in my body
When it comes out I don't recognize where it hails from.

Excitement running loose leads me back to my former home, heights my voice no longer fits
No sound comes out, the fissures appear and the squeak comes out.

I've lived in this body my whole life
Lately my voice doesnt sound like mine.

He sounds like someone confident, in charge, and caring.
That voice belongs to someone who cares deeply and only loves in the same depth.
His thoughts aren't fully formed but neither are mine.
But his premature jumble falling out becomes organized and deliberate
He doesn't always sputter "i dunno" to end the sentence
He pauses, he is patient and listens, or tries to.

I'm listening for my voice, the one that belongs to me.
All I can catch is the deep resonance of his.
I know if I listen hard enough, I'll eventually hear me in him.
That's the hope isnt it? 

You never stop finding yourself.
I've never stopped finding myself. Finding and molding pieces that better fit thst better makes sense
I've searched my whole life for myself.
I'm not in a rush to find me im him.
I'll revel in the novelty and dream of the day I become him.
Or he becomes me.
