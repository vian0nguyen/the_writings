Hi again Vian, 

It's been a while since i've taken the time to really reflect on things. Lately life has been feeling very amorphous, blobby, continuous. 
Despite struggling a lot with my mental health I think I've made huge strides as well.

One goal accomplished: I'm no longer a QA tester at Epic! Im a Game Designer at Filament Games!
Though, my first project with BrainPOP hasn't been the simplest or the most revolutionary, I definitely can see myself staying at FG for a while into the near future. I just want to be comfortable in the monotony of adult life so i can work through some personal things like my mental health and gender things.
Speaking of, this Jan i have an appointment with my PCP to talk about testosterone! Given the struggles I've been having with my brain I am a bit scared to mess around more with my brain chemistry but my psychiatrist and therapist both assure me I'm under watchful medical observation.

I've been a bit vague about the brain stuff. I guess I'm still working on processing it myself. We thought it might be bipolar but those meds didn't get me out of bed most days. Now we're at accepting that I am someone with depression. It doesn't define me but it is part of me. A part of me that I can't control. I've been working on forgiving myself for the days I can barely do the minimum and the times i'm unmotivated and can't remember a time that i could ever do anything. It's a slow process, healing.

My relationship with Minh grows slowly stronger everyday we talk about real stuff and he talks to me about anime. I'm happy to have a relationship with my family. 

Recently, I've been talking to Be Chit and Tashi and I'm becoming slowly validated that this week off I've been spending mostly in bed, watching tv or playing games is exactly normal for the time it is. I'm really happy to get closer to a comfortable with this non-productive driven vian. After everything, we deserve it.

This year has been long and I seem to only be able to draw on the past two months. But I guess this was the year of Juniper. I met them on Lex and we started hanging out then dating. Nothing really went wrong but nothing really went super right either. Our intimacy spanned distance which felt lonlier to me. Jun taught me a lot about what i'm capable of and what I want and deserve. That kind of love is possible for me but right now I have other priorities like getting through the day.

In therapy we talk a lot about the goal of all this. Makana says it's to build a life _worth_ living. It's been difficult for me to grasp what that means for me. Meaning these days eludes me. Tashi assures me that this is common in adult life to feel like you're just going on and on ceaslessly. I don't know what's worth anything at the moment but I know I don't want to die. A huge improvement. Everyday I get out of bed, feed myself, feed fluffy, is a win. We've been winning a lot lately.

5 or 6 different med changes and now we might be at the dosage that works for me. I can only hope. 

My brother asked me, "Why do you live in Boston?" And I didn't know how to answer. Nothing is really keeping me here besides my doctors, my friends, my independance... so a lot is keeping me here. With work from home there's no reason to live anywhere. I'd leave if I had to but I don't so I'd rather not start over.

As I reflect I feel like I'm _just_ starting to muddle through the basics of life. And still I stumble. Leaving the house, doing my work, doing my best, socializing. Sometimes it gets so hard. These things must be done so intentionally and lately I haven't had the energy for much at all. So I forgive myself. 

Less than a year with top surgery -- it's been pretty awesome. I kinda forget how major the surgery was. Despite the scars sometimes it just feels like my body has always been this way. Rock climbing helps too. Training myself to get my body to move the way I need it to, to carry me forward. It's a discipline that I crave in the depression when my body makes the rules. 

So overall, things are good. And getting better. The future is uncertain but I hope when you read this you've continued to grow and stride forward into life.

Love,
Vian
