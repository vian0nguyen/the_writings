and so, it all ends
in a cycle.

im in my best black thinking of all the people that echo from this loss.
We were young and maybe the firdt time mary was hit by grief was some time in the fall.
I was still in middle school.

I remember us huddled over an esrly iphone playing triplr town
The service was long, i wasnt paying much attention. maybe i didnt want to
at every corner of the room someone was crying.

And you, she was spending the hours before the eulogy furiously translating
Di hai or someone wrote us a long eulogy and only mary had enough viet and english comprehension
i remember, as it is now, we were close and you were the only one i wanted to talk to.
You were so far away, between papers and typing and crying, the adults all huddled over your shoulder.
you could only do much and everyone older than us were looking at you

so we took a walk. we left the family, the funeral home and just talked.
Talked about nothing, anything, sometimes we would bring up memories of the fallen.

it was my first death too. we were so youmg and everyonr eanted souch from you.

Now, its your turn. Sooner than anyone would expect but thats life i guess.
we're not the kids we were before we never experienced pain like this but
I am always here to take you out on a walk, talk about nothing, anything
