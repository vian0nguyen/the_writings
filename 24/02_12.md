# 02_12 daily journal

It's monday, first time sitting down to "work" since getting sick. 

I have some jobs to apply for. Once I get that out of the way...

## re: mailman game

I think i'd like to draw? some npcs to live in the mail game world. give them some basic background for kellie to turn into scripts or something

i could start to set up the warps. maybe i could use skaterfools assets (since im not gonna make it work well enough sorry sophie) to build out the map

	BLOCKER - setting up warps would require building an indication to the player where the NPCS have disappeared to
	that or need in-world art like street signs to help clue the player to visually help them navigate the world

## portfolio

I should trust in the css i've already built for my website and start laying out projects onto single pages?

to apply to tonies i think i'd like to have an undiscoverable page with all my analog/toy type work

to prep these assets would it help to set this up in slides? as additional documentation to attatch to apps?

## outside (touch grass)

id like to pick up more jelly beans, i should decide if i want to go home. latest, go home when medications are ready -- who knows when thatll be.
