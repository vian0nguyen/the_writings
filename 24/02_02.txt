I;ve been thinking about jobs, and how id be ok with a job where I work 20$ an hr at a starbuck etc. But, i think the sleepiness i have is pretty rough. And i'd like to stay adjacent to games while im not desperate for money.

I'm gonna look at admin jobs, where i can work a desk, be an assistant or studio manager. see where that takes me.

i also wanna write up a project proposal for hopelab, make a proposal for a therapy game about healing from?? negative self talk? something to help people in a moment of crisis? how can games help with that

i can also fill out the world of the mailman game, with npc guys inspired by sophie's art. guys with their own little stuff. ala lego star wars rumors. do some drawing, of buildings or just filling things out. 

i have the energy to clean up my room when i get home (and do my tshot) probably should pick up my fluoxetine eventually (goodrx prescription). 
do laundry, return switch game (maybe pick up switch game). set myself up for success. 

these past couple days ive been getting out of bed at a decent time. My EBT card is incoming and i just need to request unemployment benefits for the week. maybe ill have a schedule and feel ok.


later todo: add project pages -- maybe ask a designer whats important to highlight in the project: individual contributions? context of the design? iterations? etc
