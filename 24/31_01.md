# whats on the docket

* im thinking about how theres some stuff im avoiding doing on my website, like making each project its own page. dont wanna do that.
* i can futz around in unity and in skaterfools.
* the only real reason i got out of bed today was because my dreams were scary and violent and i was hungry.
* maybe applying to job is a no go today
* maybe going home is a better go today -- been feeling bit wonky and maybe too much around people lately

i feel like i could maybe not Do Anything today? sophie making art makes me want to make art porhaps. maybe.

Whatever it is, i think im limiting my time on linkedin to be A day out of the week. Maybe a sort of schedule of things to do could be helpful.

maybe ill make some art for grief game. or just some Other art.

I think starting from zero sounds better than wrapping up something. I could write but what. maybe an exploration of sophies lamp guy and what is in his belly. maybe he's always reminded of home and its reflected in his belly. maybe a folk style tale about the rock inside tanvi. and how that rock came to be.
